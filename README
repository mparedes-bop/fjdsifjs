This is a text adventure based on a high school experience. There are many ways to die, and only a few ways to win. 
Manage your stress carefully, and complete encounters using your trusty items.

Also, a note: In many areas the item command doesn't do anything. 
Unless you think it would make a lot of sense for an item to be useful, don't use it.
Enjoy the game, don't get discouraged, and try not to go insane.
